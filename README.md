# big_data_class_capstone

The following repository is a collection of my work for *Big Data - Capstone Project*, offered by the University of California San Diego on Coursera. This course is part of the Big Data Specialization, which consisted of the following six courses:

<br />

* **Introduction to Big Data**
* **Big Data Modeling and Managing Systems**
* **Big Data Integration and Processing**
* **Machine Learning with Big Data**
* **Graph Analytics for Big Data**
* **Big Data - Capstone Project** 

<br />

The first five courses served as an introduction to Big Data tools and concepts, through guided coding tasks and quizzes:

<br />

*Introduction to Big Data* provided a thorough background of big data terminology and introduced Apache Hadoop. 

*Big Data Modeling and Managing Systems* discussed navigating data directories and data management for text and streaming data in real-time. This course also introduced SparkSQL queries on the cloud-computing platform, Cloudera Virtual Machine. 

*Big Data Integration and Processing* dived deeper into Apache Spark and also featured Apache Spark, MongoDB queries for JSON data, Splunk for generating graphs and reports, and also queries using a Postgres shell in Cloudera. This course introduced a lot of technology that was later used in depth in the remaining courses. 

*Machine Learning with Big Data* discussed cluster analysis, confusion matrices, and showcased KNIME and Python in a Jupyter Notebook for decision trees. 

*Graph Analytics for Big Data* involved Cypher queries in Neo4J to create social network graphs. These first five courses had detailed lessons and challenged me with the multitude of new Big Data tools I had to learn.

# Big Data - Capstone Project

This final course was the most challenging of the specialization, requiring
students to take skills learned throughout the previous courses and work on a large project. Since this course required the most independent thinking and was less lesson-oriented, only the work from the last course in the specialization is included in this repository. We were provided data for a fictional game, Catch the Pink Flamingo, which included player statistics, social circles, and purchases from a fictional in-app store. The goal was to explore how different Big Data tools can reveal more about the spending and social habits of its players to increase the fictional company’s revenue. The primary big data tools used were: Splunk, KNIME, Python, and NEO4J.

In this repository, you’ll find a Technical Appendix and final presentation slides with a detailed script of what I would say during a presentation. The **Technical Appendix** is a complete compendium of the work I have done for the Capstone. The **Final Capstone Presentation** serves as my final analysis of this assignment and features selected graphs from the Technical Appendix. Underneath each slide, there are descriptions that also function as a presentation script.

This specialization was challenging and above all rewarding, and it taught me how various Big Data tools can be used together to solve everyday problems. With a solid understanding of Big Data fundamentals, there are a lot of tools I can choose between to help me in future analyses.
